Clicky Movie Game

This is a react based web application that allows you to guess a random movie. Once you select the movie scene, the position of all the movies randomly change position. The goal of the game is to get all 12 movies guessed without selecting the same movie poster!

The goal was to showcase my skills in react by building a basic react app that has multiple components and props.

UI/UX
The design of the application uses Bootstrap 4 as a framework. It is intentionally designed to be responsive to your device. The colors used give the user a welcoming feeling with less strain on the eyes.
